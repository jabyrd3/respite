1. don't be an asshole
2. try to avoid the sorts of words that ppl get pissy about in codebase. i will figure out how to rename master branch to mainline tmw
3. (after initial team setup) don't add anybody to the keybase team without 2/3rd consensus. we gotta keep info locked down for now.
4. everything in this phase needs to stay ephemeral, plz don't take backups of chat history or anything. this is all gonna get deleted and republished in a couple months.
5. if u claim work in open_work.md but find urself overwhelmed or unable to pursue/complete it, don't feel bad about unassigning it. push your work to a branch and make a note w/ branchname, and unassign the item in that file. someone else'll be able to pick it up
